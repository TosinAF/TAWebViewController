This is a dropin webViewController that displays the Site Title & Base URL. Also inculdes Forward & Back Buttons. 
Use this to quickly add a decent looking in-app browser to your project. 

I wrote this because I couldn't find a simple drop in UIWebViewController. 

I haven't hasd the time to write some documentation but there is a demo project which walks you through implementing this webViewController into your project.

This is the first version & I plan to take it further :)
